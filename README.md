# Vaayu: The GenAI Guardian Angel

**Vaayu is an AI-first personal safety system that serves as an active, intelligent guardian. In a crisis where a user cannot act, Vaayu perceives the environment, reasons about the situation using multi-modal GenAI, and autonomously acts to ensure the user's safety.**

This project was built in three distinct, evolutionary phases, transforming from a smart tracking application into a sophisticated AI crisis manager powered by state-of-the-art GenAI orchestration frameworks.

## V1: The Intelligent Tracking System (The Foundation)

The initial version of Vaayu established a system far superior to simple SOS apps. The goal was to build a robust foundation of cloud-native services and intelligent routing before layering on complex AI.

### Key Features
*   **Secure User & Guardian Management:** A simple interface for users to manage their trusted contacts ("Guardians").
*   **"Safest Route" Engine:** Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm on map data infused with risk scores (e.g., street lighting, incident density) to calculate and display the safest path to a destination.
*   **Core Alerting System:** Featured a manual "SOS" button and a "Check-in Timer" that automatically alerted Guardians if a trip took significantly longer than estimated.

### Core Tech Stack
| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Backend** | Python & FastAPI | High-performance, async API for data processing. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + PostGIS | Robust storage and powerful geospatial queries. |
| **Cloud** | Microsoft Azure | Scalable hosting and managed services. |
| **Comms** | Twilio API | SMS-based alerting for the SOS system. |

## V2: The AI Guardian Angel (The RAG-Powered Leap)

This version introduced the "Cognitive Core," transforming Vaayu into an active guardian. It implements a classic **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern, orchestrated using **LangChain**.

### Key Features
*   **Multi-Modal Data Ingestion:** The client app streams live audio and sensor data (GPS, heart rate) to the backend.
*   **Real-Time Perception & Retrieval:** The system retrieves real-time data: it transcribes audio via **Speech-to-Text API** and fetches the user's location risk score from the PostGIS database.
*   **RAG-Based Reasoning:** The retrieved contextual data (transcript, risk score, biometrics) augments a prompt sent to a private **OpenAI API (GPT-4)** instance. This RAG pattern ensures the AI has rich, real-time context.
*   **LangChain Orchestration:** The entire `Ingest -> Retrieve -> Augment -> Query -> Act` flow is managed as a **LangChain chain**, simplifying the logic and making it more robust.
*   **Autonomous Action:** Based on the AI's decision, the chain can trigger **Text-to-Speech API** to speak to the user or alert Guardians.

### Core GenAI & Tech Stack
| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AI - Architecture** | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | The core pattern for providing real-time context to the LLM. |
| **AI - Orchestration** | **LangChain** | To build and manage the chain of logic for the RAG system. |
| **AI - Reasoning**| **OpenAI API (GPT-4)** | The central brain for situational analysis and decision-making. |
| **AI - Speech** | **Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech APIs** | Real-time Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech. |

## V3: The AI Crisis Manager & Verifiable Witness (The Agentic System)

The final version evolves the system from a simple chain into a sophisticated, stateful **AI Agent** built with **LangGraph**, capable of complex, cyclical reasoning and dynamic action.

### Key Features
*   **Agentic Perception:** The AI Agent can now command the client app to take photos, adding a visual stream to its perception capabilities. Image descriptions are generated by a **multi-modal vision model (GPT-4 with Vision)**.
*   **Stateful Reasoning with LangGraph:** The "Cognitive Core" is rebuilt as a cyclical graph using **LangGraph**. This allows the Agent to maintain state, deciding whether to continue monitoring, re-evaluate with new visual data, or escalate based on the evolving situation.
*   **Dynamic, Tool-Using Agent:** The Agent can use "tools," such as generating dynamic, context-aware guidance for the user ("I see a lit storefront 50 meters to your right, move there") or activating the "Verifiable Witness" protocol.
*   **The Verifiable Witness Tool:** When triggered by the Agent, this tool creates a secure, **cryptographically signed** incident log to serve as provable, tamper-evident evidence.

### Core GenAI & Tech Stack
| Category | Technology | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AI - Architecture** | **AI Agent** | A stateful, autonomous entity that perceives, reasons, and acts. |
| **AI - Orchestration**| **LangGraph** | To model the complex, cyclical, state-driven graph of the AI Agent. |
| **AI - Vision** | **GPT-4 with Vision** | A tool used by the Agent to interpret visual data. |
| **AI - Reasoning** | **OpenAI API (GPT-4)** | The core reasoning engine used by the LangGraph Agent. |
